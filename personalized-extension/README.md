# Personalized Extension

AI-powered accessibility Chrome extension with dynamic skill recommendations and custom skill building.

Instead of mapping disability profiles to fixed tool sets, this extension uses an AI-powered onboarding flow: users describe their needs (high-level support areas, site types, free text), and Gemini suggests which built-in skills to enable — and identifies gaps where new custom skills can be built.

## Install

```bash
# From the repository root
cd personalized-extension
npm install
npm run build
```

Then in Chrome: `chrome://extensions` → **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** → select the `personalized-extension/extension/` folder.

## Gemini API Key

The extension uses Google's Gemini API for skill recommendations and AI-powered features (alt text, text simplification). Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) — the free tier allows 15 requests/minute.

Enter the key during onboarding or in the popup Settings section.

## How It Works

1. **Onboarding** — On first install, a full-tab onboarding flow walks through:
   - Support areas (Vision, Cognitive, Hearing, Motor, Sensory, Reading)
   - Site types (News, Shopping, Video, Social, Education, Games)
   - Free-text description of additional needs
   - Gemini API key setup
   - AI-generated skill recommendations

2. **Popup** — Quick access to toggle active skills, open the skill builder, or re-run onboarding.

3. **Content Script** — On every page load, active skills are applied automatically.

4. **Skill Builder** — Create custom AI-generated skills for needs not covered by built-in skills (see `extension/skill-builder/HANDOFF.md`).
