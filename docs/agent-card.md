**Latency:** Real-time / <1s / Processing time: ___
**Dependencies:** [libraries, APIs, models]

## How it fits in the toolkit

[How does this become an auditor, adapter, or profile? What existing components does it extend or replace?]

## What it pairs with

[Other team projects this connects to]

## Limitations

[Where does it break? What can't it handle?]

## Human involvement

[Does the user control it? Does output need review? How are PWD involved?]

## Data & Privacy

[Does it collect, store, or transmit user data? On-device vs. cloud?]

## Demo *(optional)*

# Contribution: Accessible Interactive Simulations

**Code:** TBD
**Team:** Stanford (Sean Follmer, Hari Subramonyam, Lakshmi Balasubramanian, David Lin)
**Contact:** dcelin@stanford.edu
**Status:** Prototype

## What it does

Generates interactive STEM simulations that BLV learners can explore through audio, text, and symbolic modalities. Educators describe a concept and the system builds a screen-reader compatible simulation with sonification and narration.

## Who it helps

- [x] BLV (blind / low vision)
- [x] Cognitive (dyslexia / learning differences)
- [x] Other: STEM educators

## How it works

**Input:** Natural-language description of STEM concept, or existing SVG/Canvas simulation
**Output:** Interactive simulation with sonification, narration, equations, keyboard controls
**Modality transform:** Visual → audio, text, symbolic

**Module type:**
- [x] Adapter — fixes inaccessible simulations
- [x] Feature — sonification presets

## Technical

**Runs in browser?** Yes
**Latency:** Real-time
**Dependencies:** Tone.js, Paper.js, Claude/Gemini (one-time generation)

## How it fits in the toolkit

Contributes a visual-to-audio adapter for dynamic STEM content that screen readers can't reach. Could feed the corpus with sonification mappings and BLV evaluation benchmarks.

## What it pairs with

- UCL Non-Standard Speech — for BLV learners with atypical speech
- The Arc — for plain-language narration
- Google NAI — as the orchestrator

## Limitations

2D simulations only. Audio gets cluttered with too many variables. Some sonification mappings are intuitive (pitch = height), others take practice (pitch = density).

## Human involvement

Learner drives exploration via keyboard. Educators review generated simulations before classroom use. No AI in the interaction loop at runtime.

## Data & Privacy

Runs entirely in-browser. No user data leaves the device. Initial LLM call sends only the educator's concept description.

## Demo

5 physics concepts prototyped: spring motion, Doppler effect, electromagnetic spectrum, radioactive decay, orbital mechanics.

## What the team needs

Connecting with educators, learners, and accessibility researchers. Understanding real classroom constraints in accessible STEM education.
